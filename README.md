## 1. Context

This guide is written during the creation of the crypto bot. Ideas, software designs and design descriptions are found 
in this document. This crypto bot is a bot that will keep track of cryptocurrencies from a configured crypto exchange.
The bot will calculate, in first instance with a simple algorithm, to decide which coin is most profitable and 
automatic place trades in that specific cryptocurrency. 

When the system is successfully tested, this bot can be used by other persons which can buy licenses. The plan is to 
sell multiple licenses, with different caps on the trades the users will set.
